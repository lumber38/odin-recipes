<h2>A simple grilled cheese.</h2>
<p>This is a simple grilled cheese recipe that isn't much more than bread, butter, and cheese!</p>
<h3>>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Slided bread (any type)</li>
    <li>Cheese (cheddar preferred, any meltable cheese will work)</li>
    <li>Unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Begin by heating a pan over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Add a bit of butter to coat the inside of the pan. Once melted, add a slice of bread to the pan.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium, once the bread has browned, lift and add a bit more butter, then flip the slice back onto the pan so that the browned side is face-up.</li>
    <li>Add 1-2 slices of your preferred melting cheese.</li>
    <li>Once the cheese has started to warm and the both sides of the bread have browned, lift them off the pan for a moment. Add a bit more butter, put on the second slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Once the bottom of the second slice has browned, lift it, replace the cheesy bread, put the 2nd slice brown side facing cheese, and then flip it so that the final side of bread is heating.</li>
    <li>Finally, remove the cheese, cut as desired, and enjoy!</Li>
